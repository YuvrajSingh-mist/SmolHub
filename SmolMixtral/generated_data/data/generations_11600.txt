Once upon a time 32 year old woman discovered that she was very attractive to a gorgeous man. On December 22, 1975, a man on an apartment floor shot and killed a 4-year-old daughter. One day, six years later, the woman and a young girl were shot dead in her apartment, 21 years later in the basement of a local college. The victim was a 45-year-old man who had been an assistant principal for the University of Chicago. A woman gave the girl a $200,000 check. After the incident, on the 12th and 14th of December 2002, a 23 year old girl and a 23 year old man became the victim of a hate-crime raid.
The victim’s story can be read in the following chapters.
Monday, 14 December 2007
I am writing a memoir. I live with a young man who is on suicide by suicide by suicidal tendencies. Two weeks ago he came home from his hospital and called me. He stated that he is now living in his home, he was in a 22 yr age group. I was told to stay at the hospital. The woman had gone back to her room, to which the woman was told to call him. She gave notice asking for him to go home or to come home. I had a great story about how terrible it was for your child to be with someone because of the fact you left a boy with two other families in the hospital that night. My son wasn’t feeling safe in the hospital room anymore, he seemed to get off the phone but I kept walking to the hospital for my daughter. She put her head on the door and told me that she thought she was going home. I told both her that I was getting all the reports the doctor had to come in and did have to call the hospital. She told me that I really got to the hospital because she knew I had never been on my own.
She was scared to tell me that my story had gone so much wrong. I called my daughter and we went through the process of getting a lawyer. That story is the story of this life and how it can affect you, you and me.
A week later another woman called again and said that the woman who died had died because she had a son. This woman was just a child. She knew she had been murdered and the family had been devastated. One of them said she knew someone to tell her all the time because it was something she had never experienced. She talked with someone who had a different perspective on her story. She would say she was an insecure woman. She was an adult and that made no sense to her. She had no idea that other people were going through what she believed to be her life. She did not understand it at the time. She had told her story to her and they had all heard the stories of the people at that point in time before her death.
She had a very serious illness. She would often be referred to as a “black-headed ghost”. She had been a man of many names, but they always had their head buried in an inkwell. She was a friend of a woman who was living a more male character. She had a heart of gold and had a heart-broken and vulnerable woman in her life when she was in a very difficult place.
At the age of 22, I can still remember hearing the news of a 42 year old woman going out with a stranger. She said her name was on the front page by name, and that it said “The mother and the dead.” I remember seeing a message that said: “Don’t let the girl cry. Get out your cell phone, go out and scream.” She looked up at me and said, “The woman will cry. If she did cry, she would die.” This was the message of hope after the tragedy.
When the woman died, her sister reported it to her sister. The woman said something was seriously wrong and that the woman had given her a hug, “It’s OK. You just did everything right.”
At that time, I was in the hospital. There were numerous other people working on the scene but the man seemed to never leave. After the news, the women told her. The woman would describe herself as someone who has a life-threatening illness. They said, “It has happened to you.” I’m not sure how I feel right now because one of you was at my family’s home. My daughter is no longer alive but is doing well.
