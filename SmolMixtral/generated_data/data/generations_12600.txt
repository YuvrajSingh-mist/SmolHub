Once upon a time 20-year-old mother used to have a baby boy, I thought it would be a great idea to create a new life lessons for each of my boys:
Father’s story, Pagan love and the promise of a better life
I had just started thinking about this idea many years ago. I am currently studying in a different department, so I was looking for ideas and I realized, “This is great!” I am so glad to have found another place to study and learn. My favorite thing about working toward this goal is that I will not get sidetracked by my current job in finance or family and family life.

My name is Rachel and I’m a Kids & Family Physical Therapist working with kids in MTN and NY. I have been a MTN Kids and Family Physical Therapist since 2006. I have experience in many different areas of physical therapy, from primary to secondary school. I have been an active member of and taught MTN Kids and the Clinical Mental Health programs for four years, in my role as a parental therapist and through my teaching as a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist. I now see my work as a “Family Physical Therapy” and I have worked with a variety of clients. I am also familiar with clients’ financial issues, including emotional and ADHD issues including addiction issues, physical and emotional health issues of both children and adolescents (children younger than 18 and teens up until age 6). I have also gained experience of working with children of all ages and with young adults in my job. I feel fortunate to have been mentored in all areas of parenting my children through my work with MPT. My job description has been to help provide the same services to more traditional clients so clients feel safe and confident that they don’t have to leave their home for daycare or a night-time visit! My work has included parental advocacy, child care and nanny advocacy services. So what’s next in my job? Getting involved with MTN Kids.
I have been working with MTN Kids for four years in a very professional and professional way. Some of the work that was done during the year for me was teaching MLT to new moms at the age of 2 to 8 and teaching as I had in both teaching courses and working directly with MTC Members. My first job was with a local elementary school and I would spend all my time reading and attending the school newspaper. The only thing that was missing was school supplies for the kids! All of these are from my own family because my husband who is in medical school worked in a family physician which is where I got involved in my family physician. I have already lost my two children, 10 granddaughters,
