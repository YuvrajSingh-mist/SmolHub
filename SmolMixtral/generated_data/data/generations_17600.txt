Once upon a time 300 years ago, when 37,000 men were arrested and 5,000 women were dead, hundreds of thousands of men and many young men were killed and more women are still missing. That's right - we need to hear more about these women's lives - for better, in so many ways, even more pain. Why would a human life have to be so different?
How does she learn to speak the words of the Bible? How long does she have to learn these basic truths? How much more does it need to learn the letters? What would the ancient world have to offer? Who would she marry? What would she be like?
In these beautiful and powerful talks, author Sarah Riddell will share her passion in understanding Christian prayer, the importance of God and how he pursues his destiny and his destiny. She wants to share with you her testimony and her knowledge of the Bible from her own unique way back to her own childhood.
In her presentation, "Why She Wants To Have A Church" (Boston, 2008), Laura Shapiro explores how she came to seek God, how she came to live in peace and meaningful relationship with God. The key to building a church can be found in the simple test of what he knew he wanted: God’s way.

Ashanti, Herman and the Men are all women. But when we feel like it, we can't keep telling it. In Ashanti, Herman explains how men have lost trust in God and his message to his people.

Join a support group led by Sarah Hershel (Ashanti & Ashanti, Hershel & Uppsala) and for teens (age 7-11) about the power of faith and Christianity in helping others to overcome their fears and trust God.

Diana and I are traveling through Australia on a tour of the Shire. It is in the heart of Sydney's City Market.
