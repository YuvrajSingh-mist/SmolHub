------------------------------------------------Step: 10200--------------------------------------------

Once upon a time 10 months ago, I bought a bike and rode it around the countryside with my parents and his girls. I thought to myself, why is 7000km in a year when my children are living in town? Should I become a new mum or should I just spend each day on a bike. It gives me great motivation to get around. Even at 8000km is enough of a daily challenge we have.
So I asked if I had a bike in the beginning of June. I was so happy that I was able to ride. I had been thinking about it ever since. After all I love my bike and it’s nice to ride a bike anywhere with no one to use it anywhere.
So last night when I was running around a bike a friend of mine and she asked me if I might do something. She said that I had a friend that would come riding alongside me and I had just left. That’s where I met my sister yesterday. It was an event that I rode to work in and out of. We had had an amazing 11 month anniversary and that would be a memorable and unforgettable occasion.
We went to the zoo about 6 miles away. When we got there it was raining and no rain outside. The riding felt like the best thing. We wanted to stop for lunch so I would be able to get out and bike as soon as we walked in the back door. I got excited, I was so scared, but I was determined to show off. As soon as I got home, I headed to the market as I knew that it would be great!
With the sun setting at 6 am we took a walk. We started on the trail and found some cool green spaces to explore with. I would tell them about the day and a tour then would head straight up the ridge and see if I could see it in every direction. The next day, we took off in the sun and walked out.
When we got back home, all of us looked on the road on the hills. It was clear we made it down. The bikes looked like we were going to find ourselves in a different place. We rode out the opposite direction, we went for a walk around the area. At that point, we were feeling good about ourselves.
After about 20 seconds of riding, we decided to ride down the road again. The car had just dropped and we were starting to see that we had made it.
We saw the same thing in a long way. Since it was cold here and the bangs were strong it would not have gone the way we hoped it would. This time we did some great bikes and our ride was much more pleasant. After riding for about half an hour we were down here and when we finally got our bike ready, we noticed that all the bike parts in the bike were completely broken and that it had been cut down. We had to think about how bad it will be.
We got to our bike and then quickly stopped so we could move in the bike. I was happy to not get hurt and get my bike but it was a difficult ride and we could tell it was not because it belonged to us.
Here we are in summer vacation mode on this lovely bike path. This area also has great riding opportunities, which can really make the riding experience even more enjoyable. The way we ride has been so nice – people coming out of our backyard so excited to be getting out on the trails.
Now for the next part of this ride. We are bikeing more and more. I can see how the biking community is moving the landscape. I have seen so many people coming at us from everywhere and I know we are here. That is a sad thing. As much as I love bike but I am also a little lost every time. I get sick and I need help with my bike. I think it is hard to believe that this is life, not just some kind of sickness so to speak. People are always saying they are not going to be able to ride but a lot of people do.
We were also able to go for a few times each year and try to catch up on many things we missed.
I have had some amazing times. The first ride was hard but not impossible because we wanted to be together. We have also recently broken up and the fact that we are in the big city and aren’t used to being part of a pack has been a huge relief because I had moved into a small space for a new position once. Some people have said to me that the last time I rode it is to ride on the lake and go. I have nowhere left. I know that if I could make this trip
