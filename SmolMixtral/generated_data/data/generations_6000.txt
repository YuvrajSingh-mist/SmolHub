------------------------------------------------Step: 6000--------------------------------------------

Once upon a time 4 people were injured. I’m going to start again tomorrow. I’m just tired and confused. I’m about to die. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced cancer!
My friend and former roommate Danny Cuddett says:
It is amazing how different this world, we have such amazing experiences that we all do, I was once really unconscious because of it as I took refuge. We had to die in order to survive. And of course I got to look at the ocean with such a deep view and the mountains. Then some of the waves took a break and I came to my door and walked out with my bag. So they are not looking at me in the same breath. They’re thinking, “Is that okay? Is my life going to be as amazing as you have dreamed?” Then I looked at the others on the other side, like the cougars, trying to get me to stop thinking, like: how did they not see? But their sight, they didn’t look at me anyway. I had to see. I got to the bottom of the cucumbers. Then I saw that it was a giant cake and it was just the way I was. I thought… Why the hell would I do what?”
I think it was as if it was being taken care of. The next morning, I found out about the cucumbers. Well it was 11:13pm and I hadn’t seen it! It was amazing. I thought it was really funny. So I went back in. I couldn’t tell you if it was because of my lack of love. But not to me. I found the picture. Because it said it was so incredibly beautiful. I didn’t even have a friend who told me about it. I looked at Tracy and then he says he had a good time. I think he said it was so damn interesting. So I could barely remember about it because people didn’t know about it. They wanted me to stop, like I was making them laugh. I had to figure it out so I could use the photos. I didn’t look at it, but I am sure someone would have said the same after the photo he took.
It was wonderful getting to think about this. It was also a true picture because I was all like “What the hell are those in the photo? There wasn’t a word. I felt like I just had a different picture.” It was a huge blessing I’d gotten a bit excited to say the picture. I don’t think I could have done this before. The sun was rising, I was ready to see it. All the best to it. And now I know – that feeling of loss is also so beautiful!!!
As I sat down and saw someone saying “It’s very magical. I just wanted to walk this beautiful city and it would be like all cats are dead. I’ve been doing this in a big city. I’m like this in a way. I am a bird. I am not the animal when it comes to death and it hurts not to judge. I hope you stay safe and it will not disappoint. That is my life. I don’t want to believe it or you know I’m just an old crap woman. My life is better. I should be the 2nd cousins.” She said. My mom said, I took a picture from the ocean. That was the 9th photo I’ve been working at for 3 years! The world was just so chubby! and what was wrong with me? And I’m going to go and look at it like it was, like, real life. People don’t believe me. I was going to go back to you! It was like I was 3 years old at the time that made me feel so great. You’re right because in my case, I wanted to stay with myself for good health and I was going to live for life. I know I’m going to come back to get better, so this is my life time and in this life I am all for the love and satisfaction I’m getting. It was a joy I have never dreamed of. All it does is make me happy that this is my life. It is my reality. I couldn’t even think it was possible. I’m ready for it again.
I did get up every morning, get my shots up, and I had a great day. And then I went back up the highway. I went to the park and took a picture. I was not. But I got down here just as my camera was shot up. I was sitting on the side of a statue, and I just wanted to keep the shot as much as possible
