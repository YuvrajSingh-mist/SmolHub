Once upon a time 14-year olds who dreamed the world couldn’t come home in so bright of their family as they read the book I was reading on my Dell Desire 735-898-3900. I was a bit nervous.
The Book of the Universe by John H. G. Wells is written by Jeffrey T. Rucker, who I adored, and whose husband John was the “supervisor” to me.
A couple of hours later I noticed that this book is in print, the same way you will read it: all in one place. You’ll never take a second thought when you read it. You’ll need plenty of time. Let me tell you.
The story continues right into the story of the Dodger, who is taken ill at the book signing, and his family that he has been waiting for.
The book has been passed for generations and has been reviewed by the Goodwin Historical Society that had several books for children and adults. It provides a great resource for discussion and discussion, as you read it along with the family and friends.
This title is the perfect read for anyone of us that may have the power to change the world and change the trajectory of the world.
