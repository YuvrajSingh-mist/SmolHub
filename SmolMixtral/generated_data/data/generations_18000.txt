------------------------------------------------Step: 18000--------------------------------------------

Once upon a time 33-year-old teenager, J.R, was given 12 grams of caffeine. That doesn’t sound great 🙂 But on a weekend trip to Chicago and one of the 12-year boyfriend’s kids, the whole family got very upset and had to send for a lot of help. The school bus was 125 kilometers away from where I lived. I was given 15 grams, which is a whopping 10 ounces for one 12-hour trip 😈.
Then in 2017, J.R. and his family went to J.R. (Scarlet, California) and a lot of other things happened because at the end of the trip, they all had to leave their old man.
Now when in Rome, I do not have to go to 12-hour shots until when they come back to their car. They’re in their room, so J.R has to get in front of me and drop me off in our room 😂
This time there is no more rushed one 😛
And I can’t quite believe that I didn’t know this!
Because it’s one of the reasons I’ve never really done the research on 12-hour drive, but it is now on the way. 🙂
That, says J.R., is an important factor.
Because we were so tired, we started waking up at 7am 1030, and the next day we got up at 8.00 a.m.
J.R. arrived at 8:30 am but before 12:00 he started working again (and asked for someone to come visit)
At 9AM J.R. got his phone, and we went to meet up as new friends and get to know each other better. J.R. showed up, we had to ask for two, so to fill it out, we made a stop at the 2nd, and then off we went to a fancy lane with 3 girls at 7:30AM 9:30.
At 10AM there was 8:10 minutes and finally J.R. dropped the keys, they turned them over in front of us, and jokingly said “Mrs. J.”
But after that was over, J.R. showed her face when we got there and she was the one to leave.
His parents were happy for 7 ½ years and J.R. was glad to see him, so we all took him to the car and he passed down to the other 12 to their friends and had a family and took jokes from the parents there .
So far they have done 5 movies together, 2 boys, boys, and a few little ones and my family has been in the back of J.R. for 10 years.
The last time we were here, J.R. said, “I like J.R.”
He was in a wheelchair and had gotten a call from the doctor on the phone in front of J.R. that there was an alarm in his room. So we just called J.R. and I am sure there was plenty of time for him to come back 😂
So we stayed back to J.R., the parents then got a phone call from J.R., the parents wanted to check out. By the time they got back home at 9:15 they were done. 😂
I was one happy child, not only has J.R. been around 5-years-old, but I have seen so many cute t-shirts that the teachers have sent to all the teachers, such is life in Germany.
I’m happy to tell you that J.R. is getting all of his stuff back.
But I hope it won’t cost us or everyone in J. R. in the future.
Until we get J.R. back, I’ll let you know the rewards! 🙂
So as you can see, I was so nervous for how this was going to go down.
I was really worried that we might run the whole place, we were worried that if we left J.R. would be taken to a hospital for treatment anyway.
But J.R didn’t feel so bad about it, and they had all their friends all over town who were on the same side of the world 🙂
I tried my best to make him feel at ease while I was
