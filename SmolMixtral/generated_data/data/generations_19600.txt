Once upon a time 33-year-old Haiti investor Peter and his wife, Anna, bought a 60-acre property in the town of Oshawa and became co-owner of the place.
An employee of Haiti Development Finance Co., 76th Infantry Division, said the community of Oshawa's 2nd Battalion, 48th Infantry Division is about 400 miles northwest of Haiti.
They have already taken over the organization's current operation since its inception 20 years ago.
“The area has over 3,300 acres of land at this point. We're basically in a two-sided business. There is no security,” Fidelis said.
The town, which has 3,500 residents, is being built on the site of the former church, which was the former home of Henry Haiti that was rebuilt in 1953 and remains the site that is now owned by Haiti.
The business comes to the town three years after Haitian President Olofsky's administration declared its independence, and the town will remain open despite growing opposition from community groups.
A veteran of Haiti's Central African nation, Peter added he has been an economic and religious leader, adding the town has seen a growth of 55 percent in the population since 1980.
"That's a reason for me to be here," he said.
Growth of the town has been largely attributed to the town's "selling power" by private investors, Haitian and international investors. This has happened in recent years despite efforts by the island's government to persuade it to become a "public entity" of the village.
"When I made the decision to buy the town last year, I thought that if I wanted to get some funding I would do the lot and I could do it myself," Haiti's finances coach Winston Hickman said. "I was just hoping to get my hands dirty and get some of the people out to have a say because that way you can take care of your family and those who's money can't stand."
The village has also made $10 million a year, in addition to the restructured, five-year operating budget, according to Hickman.
His business interests have been strengthened, Hickman says.
"From what I've been told, we should have 20,000 strong in a year here," he said. "I believe we have that."
Growing rapidly across a state that has been characterized by unspoiled natural terrain and an unparalleled military presence from both sides in support of Haiti's new leader, have been among the reasons as to why Haiti hasn't enjoyed the status it deserves.
Many businessmen expressed fear this week in the face of a possible collapse of Haitian society, a fact that could cause an influx of money to the provincial government that has pumped money into the business.
The current $180 million fund is intended to help Haitian businesses, most of which are in the province, with a variety of services, including clean water and education.
"We've been investing in local companies all the way up to the present," Haiti's Mayor Jose G. Guzman wrote to the governor.
The town's financial situation, he said, "is in bad shape."
"We are well positioned to move forward, but we cannot keep our eyes fixed on the future," he said, adding that Haiti's economy is still at around 20% of GDP.
An official with the Haitian Ministry of Agriculture, which is part of Haiti's foreign ministry, reported that the majority of government support was for the state of the economy, but the president had suggested the state should receive a large government checkup to help with the economic recovery.
"The state is in serious debt, so if you're struggling financially to get through this, I'd be very willing to take out some $17 million," he said, according to the report at the time.
Another source said Haiti has been struggling with the economic decline.
He said more money will flow to the economy through the restructuring process.
"This time, we have a budget, we have a budget in place, and Haitians are being deprived here," he said. "We have to look at these things, this need for money, what the current state doesn't. It's a very difficult economic situation."
