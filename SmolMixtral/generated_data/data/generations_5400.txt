------------------------------------------------Step: 5400--------------------------------------------

Once upon a time 2020 was known to me! While I can still keep time and love blogging my time with my posts there are plenty of interesting times in between. I did a couple of websites on the blog so I decided to break down and incorporate them on my blog so I could update my blog regularly. Here are six recent blog post highlights from 2020 in addition to the upcoming news and blog posts on the blog.
We took a snapshot of 13 new blogs I wrote about during my last blog. One of my biggest blog entries was 80s fashion, and it was hard to tell 40’s fashion in 2020 when it was on my list.
Happy New Year!
Friday 17 November 2020 was the 13th anniversary of my blog. I was able to attend a very memorable event to attend a wonderful 2020 blog tour but wasn’t able to attend the events in 2020. I have only been doing some reading for months now and since then I have been learning more from the folks at DollarMom.com. I would have gotten a good deal faster, but I still had to start up my blog later to get on with things.
Lately, I have been putting my thoughts on my blog to share and am sharing with the rest of you who made blogging a reality.
My blog is one of those blogs that has me thinking that things outside of my head that I miss and that I have to deal with.
I love traveling there so I’ll stay to just be in touch with anyone I see online. 2020 was quite a great year and my blogging journey has been forever!
I also have a new blog which I want to share, and a new blog that I’m loving.
I want to keep track of the things that I want to do for next year’s book, as I want to create a blog post for the DollarMom Facebook Group

If you are inspired, we truly know the importance of doing the right things and for which you are proud to do so. 7 things to do with blogging as long as you follow these five steps:
- Make sure each day is on our calendar. By that, blogging keeps you connected throughout your journey during 40 days in the year.
- Inspiring is a big part of growing a blog because we love to have the time and space to spend with our friends.
- As a blogger, you’ll see a lot of bloggers and podcasters taking your own and not have very much control in your life.
- On how the blog works, why you have become a blogger and what blogs are you currently participating in?
- When we talk about anything we’re learning about blogs or blogs that don’t have a regular blog, the best thing to do is to keep the content up-to-date. So, the good news is that we are not just there, you can get involved, you can reach out!
- For other blogging tips, check out the blogging videos on the right side of my blog!
Lastly, I hope that in the next year, you will be able to read and use what is going on at your blog or blog in your own blog!

You can do anything you like, I’m sure but not in one word at all! I can think much better at times when people do things the way I love to do things (and many more).
