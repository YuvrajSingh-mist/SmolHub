Once upon a time 1924 was the year of the first Cottes-Auburn, and the first commercial to open for the National.
In its 1950’s the first big commercial vehicle was driven by John W. McCarthy, a former Director of Cable and Wireless Engineering Services. The car was a machine shop, and he later began building and erecting the first lighting machines at Cottes-Auburn.
McCarthy’s first production production car was the 2001 Craftsman Classic that sold in the New York and New Jersey regions. It featured both an electric and acoustic guitar on the factory floor. An inexhaustible selection of equipment, from the original 90s invention cars, to the new generation of 90s car monitors, was the inspiration for a Craftsman Classic Craft Vehicle.
Over the years, McCarthy developed a series of Craftsman retro car vehicles that were the only commercial car in its class on the street. A first of its kind for the northeast’s history was the Craftsman Racing Series, from 1915-201. McCarthy also took home the Ford Mustang from 1906-1958.
