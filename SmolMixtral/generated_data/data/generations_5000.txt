------------------------------------------------Step: 5000--------------------------------------------

Once upon a time 56 years old in my mind when I was young I had an amazing love for the ocean and a wonderful adventure. The first time I saw it I was instantly enthralled by the feeling that it had been there. I’d been looking for something truly remarkable to find a time and place in my heart for the next 25 or so years. In college I would have loved to travel to a place that held all things that are good to have, always amazed what I was truly envisioning in my life.
I am a passionate believer in the amazing world of beautiful flowers. I was introduced to flowers all over the world just to name a few. These flowers were just everywhere in my life. And I loved to be able to photograph them on this day too. You can go on my blog to see the flower show 52 years.
This past year I started out at Eden Forest. I don’t think I ever had a garden in my yard but I knew I had such a great experience. As soon as I started to grow in my knowledge, excitement and love I started to develop a passion for flowers, a love of flowers and a passion for their nature.
For a time that I have been in the flower industry my first to appreciate flowers. I know there are some that I will never forget. I have enjoyed the experience much, I have learned a lot from my experiences, I love the excitement they were giving me and I knew for sure that I was going to be able to take this journey on my own into my whole heart. I have grown up a real fan of flowers and have never felt so fortunate with flowers; I still have the memories. I have loved to give flowers to my family. It was a tough decision for me because I know how far away I am in the world, even when there is just about no flowers and I really enjoy getting to feel them.
The process for flowers has become much easier, easier and more fun. As many of you know I love to make flowers and I am grateful to be involved in every step of this process from creating butterfly pages. The process is fast and easy. I like to keep a journal of my progress, and I really like to share the amazing moments that we had together, sharing.
Most of all, I love this time of year. I know I am too busy and too busy to keep up with my work. It has also been amazing. It’s nice to feel so welcome when you have new experiences that bring something home. The thing about flowers is that they really reflect everything about your personality so I have a very appreciative view on what they do. It takes the same skill to be a flower girl. It just feels nice. I will be spending time in the garden and that all the good things I have been able to experience in the past year that I have gained. I can say I have been on the garden ever since I was ten.
The flowers of my garden and I can’t wait to see what they’ve done for you. I am so grateful for the amazing flower we have in the gardens (it is so great to go back in!)
So far I have been working to help my flowers, my beautiful garden and flowers. So I can’t wait to see this flower come to life! I can promise you that all is well and it is going well right out there!
Thanks for sharing your lovely blog, your great pictures and encouraging yourself along the way as we try to make the best of her gardens.
Here is a picture of you as a flower girl:
Your garden is beautiful and beautiful! A huge thank you to my friend Lisa and I, for making this great flower girl in my garden. Her flowers and flowers are so special just on top of my wonderful garden! I hope you’ll be enjoying this flower girl!
Thanks very much for this beautiful time today – it is so magical. I am really excited about the challenge this year so have a wonderful day!
My first flower girl I have ever known! My flower girl lives and she loves it and she is awesome. It truly is an amazing result.
I really thank all of her for helping me with that wonderful flower girl that I wanted to share with the world. Thank you ladies for your inspiration and support throughout the whole year.
Thank you again for everything I have done for you and for what has been amazingly beautiful.
I have never known that other people would use the words to express how much joy this couple has had as a teacher. I truly feel honored to have been a part of such a huge milestone year. I truly feel the love that I have for that little love and connection I have with these young plants. They are so true and so special. Please tell me in the meantime
