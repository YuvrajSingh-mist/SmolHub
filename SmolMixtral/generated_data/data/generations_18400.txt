Once upon a time 17-year-old boy in a field-frightens and starts dribbling off topples across the street, with their arms out and wielding a sword.
“It was a moment of tremendous pain where I couldn't see myself in front of,” Alyssa Velez told TMZ, where her son Chase Ruggie-Lacson, 18. “I was getting ready for the first dance, I just got into the whole thing, I was laughing so hard at myself.
“Then, when my son was born, I was going to tell them that, I was going to have to dance to that. Once I told the kids, I asked, ‘Are you kidding?'” Velez, who lived with the boy, said, because the little boy had already told Alyssa he had to get it over with.
Alyssa was in tears as the parents told her a story of losing one of her four sons during the tragedy, but didn't let that stop her from being a hero.
"I was just trying to go to the park,” she said. “I didn't know [who] was going to be killed because [he was] not at the mall."
The parents of 18-year-old Nia, a sixth-grader, and his mother, 17-year-old Alyssa, wanted to help her, but they feared a tragic death.
“I was scared and it just happened,” Nia, who was 11 at the time – “but you can go in your parents' house,” P.D., she'd tell her son “isn’t a man.”
Alyssa, who was six years old when it happened, said she’s “mommy-please,” but they’ve been in a long-distance relationship for almost eight years.
“It's been really good,” she said. "I know everybody’s just really upset that she’s moved on like this."
Cleveland Cody teacher Diann Watt is among 20 parents across the nation who have given of hope and compassion to the tragedy that has happened to the lives of their son or daughter.
This is the latest in a string of stories that have come out of the tragedy that hit the city on Wednesday and that's helped raise awareness for various kinds of charities.

Tackling TMH's loss has been a long and arduous process of overcoming, but it's been worth it. For Tackling Moms Fund, a national organization that grants grants and funding to nonprofit agencies that serve LGBT youth, the goal is to provide grants worth of about $200,000 to local nonprofits. For every $1 donated, that's $3,400. Through grants and donations, we also help women who are in serious ordeal, through advocacy and leadership.
This month, we can give back here, too.
