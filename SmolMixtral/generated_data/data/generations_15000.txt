Once upon a time 22-year-old women lived in the wake of a suicide after hanging out on their bed, and many of them found it difficult to get around even after hours.
On Monday afternoon, their friend and former teammate and friend, Nia, was found dead in a bed on a bed in the living room. As a result of the bedroom incident, Nia had lost all of her memory cards and lost all of her memory cards. It is unknown whether the three people also shared photos in their sleep.
“I thought it was the most unpleasant experience of my life, with the children, friends, family, and me having to go and fight them, and it became very hard to have peace,” Nia, Nia’s husband, said Wednesday.
When the three of them left the bedroom, Nia’s wardrobe was in a closet.
“Were it not for this moment, this morning, I would not have survived what anyone might have done and will never learn to love again. You would not feel proud that I had lost my friend,” said Nia’s second-in-command, Sandra.
Even though the couple never told Nia she was not in love with anyone, the couple has maintained a good relationship through which all three have their lives together.
“My best friend is alive and I know she is going to be a life-long friend. I hope to do well in life and hopefully I will enjoy this journey because you go through the pain you are living and that’s what your relationship with loved one is really about”, Nia said.
